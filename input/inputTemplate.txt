##  determin_lambda=0:use scan_lambda and so on,  
##                  1: use criterion: lambda=-lambda_6(30/48+24*P_G)
##                  2: try to lower lambda to get the lowest mass while still only having one extremum 
##                     in the potential in the range given by scan_derivative_min ... _max
##                     scan_first_derivative has to be set to one
##                     Note: starting lambda will be lambda_max and the decrement will be the abs of lambda_step
##                     Only the lowest successfull lambda will be put out.
##                  3: Decrease lambda until the second derivative of the potential get negative in a given range
##                     (principle as for det_lambda=2) but want to add lambda_max_step, to not neccessarily go in small steps
##                     Maybe only test the potential for values larger than the vev, since negative curvature for small 
##                     field is not bad

## how to iterate the potential to get the mass
## 0: take the approach as in P.G. thesis and replace the masses in the propagatorsums by hand
## 1: take as masses in the denom:(m_0^2+12lambda v^2 + 30lambda_6 v^4 for higgs)

The program "scanEffectivePotentialByParameters" tries to find the Higgs mass for a given set of input parameters and 
is able to scan in those parameters.
 
 Input parameters are:
 
 - L0, L1, L2, L3 (Lattice extend (so far only periodic BC) )
 - N_f, r rho (if different from 1, 0.5, and 1)
 - cutoff_in_GeV (can be scanned)
 - y_t top (yukawa coubpling ,can be scanned) )
 - yRatio  (y_t/y_b, can be scanned)
 - lambda_6 (from a term in the action: lambda_6 * (phi^dagger phi)^3, can be scanned)
 - lambda (quartic selfcoupling, can be scanned)
 
For lambda there are several ways of determining tha value used (which on is set by determine_lambda)
following possibilities:
0 - use lambda like all other parameters (either one fixed value or a scanning range)
1 - use a stability bound: (lambda = -lambda_6*(30/48 + 24*P_G)
2 - test after the determination of the higgsmass, whether the resulting potential has no further extremum in a given region
    which is specified by the scan_derivative parameters.) Lambda is decreased until this happens and the last lambda 
    value without a second extremum is used.
3 - test after mass determination if the potential has negative curvature for phi-values between the vev and an upper 
    bound determined by the scan_derivative parameters) principle as 2
For 2 and 3, there is the parameter 


Further one can scan the first and second derivatives afterwards 
(independent of whewther or not they are used for the lambda-determination)

The program takes as input an input file (example in input/inputTemplate.txt)

The iteration scheme, that is used to find the higgs boson mass is given by iteration_scheme
Following possibilities are:
0 - the masses in the propagatorsums are inserted by hand: the value for the Goldstone boson is set to zero
    and for the higgs it is given by the curvature of the potential at the vev
    The general principle here is to determine m_0^2 by requiring that the first derivative at the vev vanishes and determine m_H^2 afterwards. Iterate until there is a stable soloution
1 - The masses in the propagator sums are given by:
    Higgs: m_0^2 + 12.0*lambda*vev*vev + 30.0*lambda_6*vev*vev*vev*vev
    Goldstones: m_0^2 + 4.0*lambda*vev*vev  + 6.0*lambda_6*vev*vev*vev*vev
    This approach also includes the bosonic determinant, since it now depends on the vev.
    Here the only requirement is to get a stable solution for m_0^2 to get a extremum at the vev
    However, this method does not work so well
